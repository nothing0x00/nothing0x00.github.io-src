I come into the security space from a background in academia, though the current state of academia is no place for someone trying to both pay bills and eat. So, I went into the only other thing I could both do and enjoy, what is loosely referred to as the information security space, specifically OSINT research and then pentesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collected here will be posts about security research, CTF writeups, tool releases and the like. Hopefully they will prove useful and contribute to the furtherance of privacy, security and digital freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Introduction"></category><category term="#intro"></category></entry></feed>
